// command: refuse to file a backlog row via `gh issue create` when its body is missing a required section
// #735: THE SAME GATE #707 PUT ON THE CLAIM SIDE, CALLED FROM THE FILING SIDE INSTEAD.
//
// #771: NOTHING RECORDS WHO FILED A ROW, SO A BACKFILL LIST CANNOT BE ADDRESSED. GitHub's `author` is the
// one fleet account for every row, and a `session:` label means CLAIMED, not filed (the 2026-09-09
// ruling) -- so for 25 of 27 rows measured missing a required section, nothing named who filed it, and an
// instruction to "send each filer its incomplete rows" could not be carried out. The two that COULD be
// attributed were attributed by accident: two from a session's own memory of filing them, one because
// `orchestrator` happened to write "Filed by `orchestrator`" in prose. That last one is the whole
// argument -- the information is useful, somebody wrote it by hand once, and nothing asked for it.
//
// So this writes `Filed-by: <session>` into the body -- a body LINE, never a label. A label means
// CLAIMED (the same ruling), and a `filed-by:*` label would put two different meanings in one namespace,
// exactly the collision #683 records: `session:` was asked to be both a claim about the present and a
// record of the past, and removing it on close (#754) destroyed the second. A body line has the property
// the label lacked: it is a record, so nothing later ever needs to remove it.
//
// `--session=<name>`, REQUIRED, the identical flag `row-claim.mjs` already uses for the same fact --
// never a separately-named flag (`--filed-by=`) a caller could set to anything unrelated to who is
// actually running this. One place a session states its identity, not two that could disagree.
//
// `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/backlog-row.yml` marks Region, Acceptance and Open-check `required` -- but that
// is a GitHub issue FORM, and forms apply only in the web UI. Every row this fleet files goes through
// `gh issue create --body`, which bypasses the form entirely, and nobody discovered a row was incomplete
// until someone tried to claim it (#707). Measured 2026-09-09 (worker-capture, #735):
//
//   open rows examined: 76
//   missing at least one required section: 36
//     missing Region: 25 | Acceptance: 5 | Open-check: 28
//
//   #0-399    8 of 36 (22%)
//   #400-599  9 of 11 (82%)
//   #600-699  10 of 18 (56%)
//   #700+     9 of 11 (82%)   <- of the eleven newest, exactly two carried all three
//
// The rate rises with recency because the more the org files its own work with `gh issue create`, the
// more of the backlog becomes un-claimable -- the web form's enforcement never runs against that path.
//
// ceo's ruling: refuse at FILING, not only at claiming, so the cost lands on whoever holds the context,
// not on whoever picks the row up later. In worker-capture's own words, filing #677 without this:
//
//   "I wrote #677's Open-check myself and I am not confident it is the one `orchestrator` would have
//   written."
//
// NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. `missingTemplateFields` is #707's own pure function, imported from
// `row-claim/template-fields-rule.mjs` unchanged -- the identical rule row-claim already enforces at
// claim time, asked here one step earlier. A body that would pass this refuses nothing later, and a body
// that would fail `row-claim claim` cannot be filed in the first place.
//
// `cli-flags.test.ts`'s discovery guard requires EVERY argv-reading file here to call
// `refuseUnknownFlags`, on a small, CLOSED, shrink-only exemption list this file does not qualify for --
// so `KNOWN_GH_ISSUE_CREATE_FLAGS` below is `gh issue create --help`'s own flag surface (read 2026-09-09,
// gh's current stable release), not a subset this wrapper invented. A flag it does not yet know is
// refused with the near miss named, same as any other guarded CLI here -- the cost of a genuinely new
// `gh` flag arriving is a refusal naming it, not a silent pass-through. Every argument that IS known still
// passes through to `gh` unexamined -- this file checks nothing about VALUES, only that the flag NAME is
// one `gh issue create` actually reads, which is `refuseUnknownFlags`'s whole job everywhere else in this
// tree, applied to a wrapped external tool instead of to this file's own flags.
