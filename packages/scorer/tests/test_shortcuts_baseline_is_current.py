"""The tracked shortcuts baseline must name only features the pipeline still computes.

`packages/lab/scripts/scorer-shortcuts.baseline.json` records the free vetoes a human has looked at and
accepted; `audit-scorer-shortcuts.py --update-baseline` writes it, and every other run compares against it
via `compare_to_baseline`. A row's veto list is built once, by a human, and never revisited except by that
comparison — and the comparison is COUNT-based per subtype (`closable_count(row) > closable_count(was)`),
never a per-feature identity check against the baseline's own entries.

That gap is real and was measured, not assumed: withdrawing a feature from `FEATURE_NAMES` removes it from
every freshly-computed row (`audit()` only ever iterates `features.FEATURE_NAMES`), which can only ever
equal or LOWER a subtype's closable count relative to what the baseline recorded — never raise it. So a
stale feature name is invisible to `compare_to_baseline` in both directions: not a regression (count did
not increase), not even a printed note (the function emits nothing for an unchanged or improved count).
Confirmed empirically against the real tracked baseline: simulating today's computation by removing
`post_submit_observed_present` (withdrawn in the v19 postSubmit cross, commit `f61d325`) from the two rows
that named it and calling `compare_to_baseline` on the result returns exit code 0 with no output at all —
the exact "NOTHING NOTICED" this test exists to end.

This is the identical shape `test_unclosable_map_is_current.py` already guards at the sibling site
(`runs/unclosable-vetoes.json`, emitted from `audit-corpus-starvation.mjs`'s `IMPOSSIBLE_BY_DEFINITION`
table) -- that test's own docstring records it catching a stale entry on its first real run. The baseline
had no equivalent, so this is modelled directly on it: read the canonical feature list from the module
rather than restating it, and refuse silently rather than passing having examined nothing.

Deliberately narrower than `test_unclosable_map_is_current.py`'s three checks: that file also asserts on
two CATEGORIES staying separate and non-empty, which has no analogue here -- `scorer-shortcuts.baseline.json`
is a flat `rows` array, not a two-kind map. The subtype-shape check DOES have an analogue and is included
for the same reason: a malformed subtype key can never match a real head, which is the same failure kept
from a different angle.
