"""`diagnose-false-positives.py` must REFUSE an empty --data file, not print {"records": 0}.

`main()` had no refusal at all: given an empty file it printed `{"records": 0, "subtypes": {}}` and
exited 0 -- indistinguishable from "examined everything, found nothing". Today it fails only by
accident, via a numpy broadcast error deep inside scoring -- a traceback rather than a stated verdict.

Tests `parse_records()`, the pure half `main()` calls before anything model-related loads (no encoder,
no safetensors weights, no report) -- exactly so the empty/malformed-input decision can be proved without
either. `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 pytest -p no:cacheprovider` matters here specifically:
`importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` honours `__pycache__`, and a stale compile decided a mutation
check wrongly once already on 2026-09-03 (see CLAUDE.md).
