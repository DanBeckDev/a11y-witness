"""A feature with ONE value across the whole corpus is invisible to every other check here.

**A change made on 2026-09-03 walked straight into this.** Two crossed columns were added keyed on
`observed["stateChanges"]`, which no capture carries, so both read 0.0 on every record — a dead column
that looks like coverage. It would have survived a full retrain, because each existing check asks a
narrower question:

- `corpus:starvation` asks whether a feature is constant on a SUBTYPE's positives. A corpus-wide constant
  is constant there too, so it appears once per subtype as more entries on a work list nobody can
  complete, rather than once as the fact that explains all of them.
- `scorer:shortcuts` reads TRAINED WEIGHTS, so it cannot speak until a train has been paid for.
- `corpus:distribution` asks whether an ARRAY FIELD is empty on every record. A computed feature is not a
  field and is not in the export at all — so it is structurally blind to this, and it had been NAMED as
  the gate for exactly this question in `schema-migration.json`. **A gate named for a fault it cannot
  express** is how the gap was found.

Tested here rather than end to end because the local `runs/` copy predates the `parsed` block and the
audit correctly refuses it — so an integration test would prove only that the refusal works.
