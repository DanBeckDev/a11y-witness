"""The trainer and `releasability.mjs` must apply ONE rule for type-I error.

The rule exists twice because it must: the trainer decides `releaseEligible` in Python at train time and
the gate decides the release in JavaScript at promote time, and neither language can import the other. So
CLAUDE.md's first two remedies for a fact stated twice -- delete a copy, derive one from the other -- are
unavailable, and the third applies: pin them equal with a test.

They HAD drifted, and it cost a diagnosis on 2026-08-25. The trainer blocked on
``if falsePositive or falseNegative``, zero tolerance left over from before Neyman-Pearson calibration,
while the gate had moved to the bound the threshold was actually chosen for. BOTH TEST SUITES PASSED --
`releasability.test.ts` covers the gate thoroughly and `test_np_threshold.py` covers the NP maths
thoroughly, and the contradiction lived between them where no compiler could see it.

The cases live in `scripts/fixtures/calibration-verdicts.json`, read here and by `releasability.test.ts`.
Neither side may edit them alone: a change that makes one implementation pass will fail the other.
