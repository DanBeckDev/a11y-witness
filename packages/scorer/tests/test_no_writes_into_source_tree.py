"""A run may write to runs/, never into packages/.

Measured 2026-08-23, and the second consequence was much worse than the first. An acceptance run scored
the SHIPPED model and stamped its verdict into that model's own training report, overwriting the record
of what was true when those weights were released with the result of a run that released nothing.

Then, because `packages/` is tracked, the lab checkout was dirty. `run-job.yml` refuses to pull into
somebody's uncommitted work — correctly — so the lab ran **17 commits behind origin for days**, every job
reporting the true and useless sentence "Not pulling: the checkout is dirty".

Both halves are guarded now: this refuses the write, and `lab-job.test.ts` requires the drift to be
reported as a NUMBER. Two independent guards because they fail independently — a different script writing
into packages/ would recreate the second problem without touching the first.
