"""A test-grade dataset can never produce a releasable model.

Test grade exists so a question can be answered without a four-hour recapture: it accepts captures whose
page has moved, because "did my change move the number?" needs the cases I CHANGED to be current and the
rest to be present at all. A veto, a starvation count and a signal check are all computed per subtype, so
untouched subtypes contribute the same answer either way.

That is a sound way to test and a catastrophic way to ship. Measured 2026-08-26: a corpus change left
1,082 of 1,401 pairs stale, an export dropped them, and a retrain would have used 319 pairs — a worse
model that every gate scores as if it were whole. Test grade makes that dataset usable AND makes the
model it produces structurally unpromotable.

Three independent gates, and this asserts the first two:

  1. The trainer sets `releaseEligible` False at INITIALISATION, before any gate can set it True. An
     eligibility that starts True and is cleared later is one a later branch can quietly restore.
  2. It says WHY, in `releaseBlockedBy`, so the refusal is readable rather than a bare False.
  3. `promote-model.mjs` refuses a model that is not release-eligible — covered by promote-model.test.ts.
