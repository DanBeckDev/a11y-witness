"""`training:evaluate-acceptance:*` must NAME its failures and refuse to rewrite released provenance.

Proves two decisions inside the gate `training:evaluate-acceptance:shipped` and its `:candidate` sibling —
the same evaluator runs for both, differing only in which weights it is pointed at.

## Why `metrics` naming its failures is a gate property, not a nicety

It returned counts alone. Measured 2026-08-23 against the shipped model on a fresh held-out set:
`1.3.1: acceptance false negatives` and `2.4.6: acceptance false positives`, two of each. From the report
it was impossible to tell whether that was *one subtype systematically missed* or *two unlucky pages* —
and those need completely different responses. Answering it meant re-running the evaluator by hand with
print statements.

This is the repo's most-repeated rule pointed at its own release gate: a count is where an investigation
stops rather than starts.

## Why the source-tree refusal is the more expensive of the two

Scoring the SHIPPED model is legitimate — it is how you learn whether production weights still pass the
held-out set. Stamping that verdict into the model's own training report is not: it overwrites the record
of what was true when those weights were released with the result of a run that released nothing.

It happened. `training-report.json` came back carrying `generalisationVerified: false` on weights that had
shipped clean — and the second cost was larger: `packages/` is tracked, so the lab checkout was dirty,
`run-job.yml` refused to pull into somebody's work, and **the lab ran 17 commits behind origin for days**
while every job said "Not pulling: the checkout is dirty" and none said what that meant.

## Why this needs neither the acceptance set nor a model

Both are pure: `metrics` over four small arrays, and the refusal over a path. The register's premise —
"needs the held-out acceptance set, which is 104 captured records and not synthesisable" — is true of
producing scores and false of judging them. Ten premises challenged, ten false; see
`docs/proving-a-gate.md`.

    `metrics` already learned that a count is where an investigation stops rather than starts, and began

    veto failed acceptance on exactly one case, and the report could not say whether it scored 0.90

    lost the finding. Those need opposite responses. Answering it meant reverting the change and reading
    the training report, which is the expensive direction.
