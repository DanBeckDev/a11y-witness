"""A blocker list must contain only things that block.

`releaseBlockedBy` was derived by promoting EVERY warning once calibration was unclean. So a purely
informational note — "23 development record(s) masked as unknown by their publisher's claim", which
`known_indices` has already handled by excluding those records from the head entirely — appeared as
something standing between the model and a release.

Measured 2026-08-23: 40 blockers, 12 of them that note. Comparing 0 blockers on the shipped model against
40 on a candidate, a reader cannot tell a corpus that grew from a model that got worse — and I nearly drew
exactly that conclusion before checking that the candidate covered 13 criteria to the shipped model's 8.

The distinction already existed and was discarded at the last step: a blocking note flips
`calibrationClean`, an informational one does not. `note()` records it where the decision is made.
