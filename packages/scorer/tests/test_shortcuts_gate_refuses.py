"""`scorer:shortcuts` must refuse a head that GAINED a free veto, and one nobody has audited.

Proves the VERDICT shared by `scorer:shortcuts` and `scorer:shortcuts:candidate` — the same
`compare_to_baseline` runs for both, differing only in which weights produced the rows.

## What a free veto is, and why no accuracy number can see it

A veto is a feature that is 0 on every training positive of a subtype. A linear head may give it a large
negative weight at no cost, because nothing in training punishes it — and no held-out split can punish it
either, because the split has the same structure. ADR 0015 measured the shipped weights: 225 such vetoes,
the worst being `form_field_named` at -4.33, which means the scorer reports an unnamed control **only on a
page where nothing is correctly named** — a description of almost no real site.

Held-out acceptance (58 TP / 0 FP / 0 FN), `npm run eval` and `rules:gate` are all blind to this *by
construction*. This gate is the only thing that is not.

## Two findings that must not be collapsed

**REGRESSION** — a head with more vetoes than the baseline. The corpus separated two things it should not,
or a feature was added that no positive carries.

**UNAUDITED** — a head absent from the baseline. Measured 2026-08-26: correcting `SCORED_CRITERIA` to
match the shipped model brought five long-standing heads into scope and the report announced them as five
regressions that "gained a free veto". *They gained nothing; nobody had looked.* Both still block — an
unaudited veto is not a safe one — but the wording decides whether somebody investigates the corpus or
records a baseline, and sending them at the wrong one costs a day.

## Why this needs neither weights nor corpus

`compare_to_baseline()` is pure over a list of rows and a baseline path. `audit()` needs the model; the
VERDICT does not. The register's premise for this gate — "needs trained weights AND the exported corpus,
because a veto is a property of the two together" — is true of producing the rows and false of judging
them. That premise has now been wrong nine times running; see `docs/proving-a-gate.md`.
