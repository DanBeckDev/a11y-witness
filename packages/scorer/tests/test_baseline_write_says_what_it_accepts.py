"""Writing the baseline must SAY which rows it changes, because it rewrites the whole file.

`--update-baseline` is documented as "a deliberate act with a flag, never a side effect of running the
audit", and that protects against an ACCIDENTAL write. It does not tell whoever performs it what they are
signing, and the two are different guarantees.

MEASURED 2026-09-05, and this is a defect that already happened. The tracked baseline was written to record
`1.4.13`'s eight new vetoes — all on a rules-decided subtype, so all shielded. The same write silently
accepted `form_change_observed_absent` on `3.3.1:validation-error-silent` and
`4.1.3:form-activation-silent`, neither of which has a `rule-ownership.json` entry, so both are
MODEL-decided and both can reach a report. That is precisely the ADR 0015 harm this audit exists to catch,
and `not-working.md` §2 went on reading "CLOSED — ZERO free vetoes can now reach a report" for five days.

The gate itself cannot catch it: `compare_to_baseline` fails on `closable_count(row) > closable_count(was)`,
and once a veto is IN the baseline there is nothing to exceed. A metric computed against a baseline that
absorbed the flaw cannot see the flaw — CLAUDE.md's own sentence, one layer out.

Nothing here blocks. This runs at the moment somebody has already decided to accept; what it removes is the
ability to accept something without being shown it. Same shape as `promote:model` printing the provenance
it is about to write.
