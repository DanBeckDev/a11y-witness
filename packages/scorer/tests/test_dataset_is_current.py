"""A derived dataset whose source has moved on must STOP the train, not quietly train on it.

On 2026-08-24 a retrain consumed a `with-realism.jsonl` built before 44 new cases existed: the export held
2,366 records and training reported 2,349. Every step succeeded. The missing one -- `build-realism` --
simply left an older file in place, and a full capture/export/train/sweep cycle produced a model that had
never seen the corpus change it was run to measure, plus a real-page number that meant nothing.

The guard re-hashes the SOURCE rather than trusting the sidecar's own description of it, so it shares no
failure mode with the build. And it hashes rather than comparing mtimes, because timestamps move for
reasons that are not content.
