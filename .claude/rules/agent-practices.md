# Agent practices — every session in this repo (chairman's direction, 2026-09-11)

These load with CLAUDE.md in every session. They are habits, not gates; the org clock on #912 reads
whether they are followed.

## Model routing for subagents

- `model="haiku"` for data gathering: file reads, counting, directory walks, grep, API listings.
- `model="sonnet"` for analysis and judgment over gathered material.
- `model="opus"` only for multi-step reasoning that a cheaper tier has measurably got wrong.
- Measured 2026-09-10 over 30 days: Opus carried 66% of billable tokens and Haiku under 1%, with no
  routing rule anywhere. Every subagent call names its model.

## Context

- `/compact` at 50–70% context fill, before auto-compact; quality degrades past 70%.
- `/clear` between unrelated topics; a fresh window beats stale history.
- Batch related requests into one message; every round-trip re-sends the whole config stack.

## Web research

- Measured 2026-09-11 over 30 days: 576 web search and fetch calls put about 2.9 million tokens of page
  content into main-session contexts. Run research in a subagent (`haiku` to gather, `sonnet` to
  digest) so the pages stay in its context and only the digest reaches yours; ask for a digest with
  sources, never a page dump. One fetch that the main session must read itself is the exception, not
  the habit.

## Timers and state

- Every session holds one standing cron (engineers every 10 min, the fleet operator every 10 min while
  fleet-gated rows remain, the product-manager every 30 min) and declares it on #912 after every start
  or restart. `CronList` is the first command after any restart: a restart wipes every cron silently.
- The row is the state. Read the row, the PR and the API before acting on any message, including one
  from ceo.
- A product PR opens as a DRAFT and is marked ready only when the reviewer writes "convinced";
  docs-and-tests PRs open ready. Nobody merges by hand.
